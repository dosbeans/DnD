A ritual spell that requires more Light than any caster could produce. Points would need to be set up to determine the boundaries. [[Light]] dense souls would be required to be at each point. After each is killed, a large beam of light emerges from the city, engulfing everything. The beams of light do not disappear until the ritual is complete or fails. After all points have been lit, walls rise up, connecting the points. Then the walls shrink in and begin engulfing the entire area until nothing is left.
