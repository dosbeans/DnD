Timeline
	Lumene was not always such a wonderous world. There was a time when Lumene was ordinary compared to today. That era was aptly named the [[Dark Ages]]. During this time there was no [[Light]]. The [[First Light]] was the first significant event in Lumene's history. Its discovery brought forth the era named, [[The First Flame 0-443.FL]]. With that came the establishment of the major kingdoms; [[Eretelle]], [[Morgana]], [[Rimefall]], [[Gildesh]], and [[Epoch]].

At some point a meteor falls from the sky which has a "god" in it.
