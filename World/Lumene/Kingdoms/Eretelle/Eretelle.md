The people of Eretelle are called Erelites.
Eretelle is one of the four major kingdoms of Lumene. The capitol of Eretelle is Mitras. They are constantly trying to be number one against Morgana. The geography of Eretelle is quite the same as Morgana, except for the capitol's location. The western coast is lined by mountains, and the royal family, [[Grymm]] were quick to name it Oresfall. North-East of the River Grymm are grassy plains that are an essential part of the continent's agriculture. Once again the Grymm family with the help of Aldrich, revolutionized farming with their invention of magically imbued tools. Between the River Kyrs and Grymm, is the Heathwood Forest.
