Light is the system that allows people to cast spells and fuel superhuman feats. It is raw energy that is found in everything, but more concentrated in people. It is almost impossible to handle Light, but with the discovery of mana, usage is much simpler. Look [[First Light#^352b24|here]] for the discovery of Light.

Mana
	Mana is the resource used to cast spells, and is fueled by Light. Only some can harness mana, and it can be directly compared to a muscle. Mana can be trained to increase its quantity, and can also be exhausted in the same way a muscle can. However, mana does not take a physical form and is rather some kind of energy tied to the soul.

Spells
	Spells are the final step in refining Light. The hardest part of spellcasting is visualization and imagination. Verbal, and or, somatic elements are often needed to cast spells as they aid in envisioning the outcome. On rare occasions, a material component may be required to fuel a spell's high demand for Light. Some materials have inherently higher concentrations of Light than others. The soul is very powerful as mana is directly tied to it.
		For some, spellcasting is second nature, and those people have forgone the verbal element. This act has been dubbed as silent-casting. A common practice to train silent-casting is Prestidigitation, as it requires both a verbal and somatic component. It also forces the user to imagine what the outcome will be.

Scrolls
	 Scrolls are the result of harnessing spells and imbuing them into parchment. First pitched by the peasant Skullgrymm family of Eretelle, the prodigal son, Archall attempted its creation. First iterations were made by inscribing glyphs of warding into parchment, but later refined to a much simpler version. The current creation method uses a highly modified version of glyph of warding that is kept somewhat secret.
