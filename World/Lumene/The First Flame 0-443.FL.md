This era is between the [[First Light]] and [[Golden Age]]. Before a year had passed, two comets appeared in the sky. By the year 37, all New World kingdoms have been established. This is the order of their creation: [[Eretelle]] and [[Morgana]], [[Rimefall]], [[Gildesh]], and [[Epoch]]. More than 50 years had passed since the appearance of the two comets, yet one grew larger and brighter. By the year 281, the comet, now named [[Celestina, Goddess of the Stars|Celestina]] was impossibly large. Finally, less than a year later, the comet vanished but the world shook. Many citizens from across the kingdoms described what they experienced to be a bright flash followed by a vigorous tremor, yet the objects in their homes did not fall.
Much of the progress on the mechanics of Light and mana works happened during this era. For a few years it was commonly believed that an instrument's music was required to cast spells. Eventually, words and phrases replaced the rough techniques imposed by instruments. By the end of the era, all scholarly spells were created. This is also the time in which scrolls were created by the [[Grymm]] family. Their generous actions spread magic to people that were incapable of harnessing Light on their own. Aldrich, their son, ventured the world to save people with his skillful usage of Light.
